## Setting up Wordpress with forums

This is a typical setup of wordpress I'd like to use to get going.

After installing Wordpress, install the following plugins and themes and activate them all:
* [bbpress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bbpress/)
* [Simple custom CSS plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-custom-css/screenshots/) (Make sure to backup your css frequently)
* [Mailchimp for wordpress plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/mailchimp-for-wp/) (Don't accept immitations!)
* [Nudie theme](http://nudiewp.com/) (It's around $50).

#### Pages
* To have a separate forum section, create these pages at a minimum: **Home, Blog, Forums**

#### Forums
* Create a main forum section with all defaults selected. Call it anything you'd like.

#### Topics
* Create a topic with defaults selected except: nest it under the forum you just created above.

#### Appearance (Widgets)

##### bbpress
Hello
