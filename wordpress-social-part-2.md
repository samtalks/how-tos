# Setup WP 2: Facebook, Group-based Permissions, Analytics

Here are the plugins we will install:
* [Wordpress backup](http://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/backupwordpress)


### [Wordpress backup](http://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/backupwordpress)
This is a highly rated backup tool that I found simple and useful. Install this plugin and set the schedules. That's it.



[Nextend Facebook connect](http://wordpress.org/plugins/nextend-facebook-connect/screenshots/). This enables one-click registration with facebook. 


```
sudo apt-get install php5-curl
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
```

Here's the stuff for [Google Analytics](http://
